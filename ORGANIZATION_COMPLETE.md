# 🎯 SecureScout - ORGANIZATION COMPLETE

## ✅ DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OPTIMIZED

Your SecureScout project has been professionally organized with the following clean structure:

### 📁 **Core Directories**
- **`core/`** - Main scanning engines (4 files)
- **`tools/`** - Specialized scanning tools (13 tools) 
- **`scripts/`** - Execution & utility scripts (5 scripts)
- **`config/`** - Configuration files (6 configs)
- **`results/`** - All scan results organized by type
- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive test suites (4 test files)
- **`docs/`** - Complete documentation (14 guides)
- **`logs/`** - Application logs (3 log files)
- **`cache/`** - Smart caching system (persistent storage)

### 🚀 **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/kali/NMAP

# Run SecureScout (auto-activates virtual environment)
./scripts/run_securescout.sh [target]

# Test smart caching system
source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/test_smart_cache.py

# View performance logs
tail -f logs/nmap_automator.log
```

### 📊 **Organization Benefits**

| Category | Before | After | Improvement |
