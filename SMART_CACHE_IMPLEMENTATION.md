## ðŸ§  Smart Caching Implementation (Brief)

Smart caching in SecureScout provides:
- Adaptive TTL and priority-based eviction
- Predictive caching and cross-session persistence
- Real-time analytics and memory optimization

Performance improvements include faster startup, higher cache hit rates, and hands-free optimization.
@performance_optimized(ttl=600, smart_cache=True)  # 10-minute adaptive TTL
def build_nmap_command(target, ports, scan_type, evasion_profile):
    # Command building cached with smart adaptation
    # Frequently used commands get extended TTL
    # Complex evasion profiles get priority scoring
```

### **2. XML Parsing with File Invalidation**
```python
@performance_optimized(ttl=3600, smart_cache=True)  # 1-hour adaptive TTL
def parse_nmap_xml(xml_file):
    # File modification time included in cache key
    # Expensive parsing operations get extended TTL
    # Results cached until file changes
```

### **3. Tool Availability Checks**
```python
@performance_optimized(ttl=300, smart_cache=True)   # 5-minute adaptive TTL
def check_nmap_available():
    # Tool availability rarely changes
    # High-frequency checks get extended TTL
    # System changes invalidate automatically
```
